# This is a stupid practice on what if statements are
# Rust programmers laughing at python users with a billion if statements
# (literally me)

# Example one
# hasCat = input("Do you have a cat? ") # this is a super shitty way to do this, booleans when
# if hasCat == "Yes" :
#     print("You have a cat!")
# else:
#     print("Why do you not like cats!")
# print("Thank you for your response.")

# Example 2

money = int(input("How much money do you have? "))

if money > 1000: 
    print("You can buy a pc!")
elif money > 500:


    print("You can buy a cheap console!")
else:
    print("You cannot buy any gaming gear. D:")
