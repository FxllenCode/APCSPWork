# A years worth of APCSP programs and notes, open source.

## Why I did this
I had to do this for APCSP. I've already done programming many times in the past (I hate python).

Please note that this is likely more advanced then it should be. The stuff we did on day 1, etc., is probably NOT what we did in class, but a more advanced version. 

## Why python?
For some reason, my school district likes to use the sluggish snake language to teach students to program.

Please read STOP_USING_PYTHON.md for more info.
