# A years worth of APCSP programs and notes, open source.

## Why I did this
I had to do this for APCSP. I've already done programming many times in the past (I hate python).

Please note that this is likely more advanced then it should be. The stuff we did on day 1, etc., is probably NOT what we did in class, but a more advanced version. 

I can't imagine this is helpful to anyone, but it's here!

## How to use?

I don't really care what you do with this, but if you want to use it, you can just clone the repo and run the python files. Or read the notes if you want. Doesn't matter to me.

## How did you do?

Got an A and a 5 on the exam. Go crazy. 
## Why python?
For some reason, my school district likes to use the sluggish snake language to teach students to program.
