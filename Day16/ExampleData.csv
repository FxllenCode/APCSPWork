BETHANY ROAD AT MAYFIELD ROAD INTERSECTION IMPROVEMENTS,Completed,"This project involves intersection operational improvements incorporating a roundabout at the intersection of Bethany Road and Mayfield Road. The design of this project was awarded to Tetra Tech, Inc. in the amount of $127,670 by City Council on December 12, 2016. The conceptual design for this project was presented to City Council on June 5, 2017. As the acquisition of right of way progressed, it became necessary to revise the eastern leg of the roundabout. Change Order #1 was issued on April 2, 2018 which increased the design cost by $9,950 to $137,620. Final plans were delivered to the City on June 22, 2018. City Council awarded this project on November 5, 2018 to CMES. City Council also awarded the construction project management, inspection, and engineering to Atkins North America, Inc. Notice to proceed with construction was issued for July 24, 2019. Construction was delayed due to weather and utility relocations.

BETHANY ROAD AT MID-BROADWELL ROAD INTERSECTION IMPROVEMENTS,Completed,"This project involves intersection operational improvements incorporating a roundabout at the intersection of Bethany Road and Mid Broadwell Road. The City has received numerous complaints regarding left turns onto Mid Broadwell Road from motorists traveling south on Bethany Road and from residents of Pindell Glen Subdivision trying to leave their subdivision. Residents have complained about the speed of vehicles on Mid Broadwell Road and have requested a reduction of the speed limit or the installation of a traffic signal or four-way stop. As these options do not meet warrants, a roundabout is proposed to reduce speeds in the area and assist in left-turn movements. The preliminary cost estimate for this project was $1.28 million with funding provided through T-SPLOST (transportation special purpose local option sales tax). The design of this project was awarded to Tetra Tech, Inc. in the amount of $131,170 by City Council on December 12, 2016.
